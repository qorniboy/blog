1. Using c libc.6.so
2. Using srand which after research is seed random set (making random predictable)
3. using __isoc99_scanf which is a char, we can assume that on betting we can input non numeric
4. iteration is up to 28 (0x1d < local_c)
5. the input local_d is going to be compared against random number with srand((int)local_d) after operation long(check + local_c *4)
6. to break this we need
flag = ""
#get all srand value
iter key < range(255): (uint8)
 srand(key)
 val = rand()
 dict[val] = char(key)
 
iter local_c < 30
 val = long (check + local_c * 4)
 srand(input)
 rand()
 flag += char(rand)
print(flag)
