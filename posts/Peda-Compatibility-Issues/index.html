            <h1>Fix Fork to Peda's Python Compatibility Issue</h1>
            <p>
                Peda is a famous and go to framework for pwn and reversing CTF challenge. Perhaps usage scope of peda itself might be wider than what I know as a newbie to hacking.
                But while messing around and reading walkthrough on a Hackthebox's Going Deeper* challenge I try firing up peda and found out a long list of errors.

                A little bit of searching turns out there are multiple issue raised on peda's github page repo* which turns out it's different regexing standard* on newer python version with addition to a dependency error. So I create a fork to fix it myself since the fix is pretty simple. 
                I hope whoever find this article while scratching their head will be helped. Here is my <a href="https://github.com/qorniboy/peda">fork address</a> or just copy paste the following.
